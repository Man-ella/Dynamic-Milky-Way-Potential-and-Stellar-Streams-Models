Stellar streams are groups of stars from globular clusters or dwarf galaxies that have been stretched out, along their orbits, by tidal forces. 
Peculiar features of some streams, eg: fanning and truncation, have been proposed to have been caused by interaction of these streams with the galactic bar.
For instance, the truncation of the leading arm of the Palomar 5 stream and the interestingly short length of Ophiuchus stream have all been linked to their interaction with the galactic bar.
In our study, we sought to answer the question: what can up-to-date N-body simulation codes tell us about how the bar affects stream formation? To do so, we took two steps in
our approach:
1. Modelling orbits
2. Modeling streams
